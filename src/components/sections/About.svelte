      Hello! My name is Chris, and I enjoy building useful tools for clients, customers, and for
      fun! I am a self-taught developer â€” but arenâ€™t we all at some point? ðŸ˜‰ I started with Ruby on
      Rails back in 2013, then entered the NodeJS ecosystem where I enjoy building elegant and
      intuitive interfaces with React. I occasionally build things with Python or Kotlin, but
      JavaScript and TypeScript are my first loves for coding. Lately, I have also been exploring
      Svelte and SvelteKit. Iâ€™ll admit, it is enticing me away from React for some projects as it is
      so simple to use, and I can focus on HTML and CSS first.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I am married to my wife, Cathy, and am a father of 2 â€” Zeb and Apphia. I currently work at HBK
      Engineering Solutions, where I help build tools and interfaces for customers to manage
      maintenance data and processing workflows.

    <p class="mb-4">Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
